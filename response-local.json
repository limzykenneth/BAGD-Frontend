I believe storytelling is our oldest and most precious technology, the ability to present and understand narratives through sequences and metaphors. In this final year I realised my work is, in its simplest form, about objects that tell stories. I love to build props and photograph them, creating worlds and narratives around: social, environmental and political concepts. I enjoy future thinking and presenting current affairs in ways that spark discussions about today and maybe, the far future.
